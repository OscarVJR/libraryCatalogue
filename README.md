# First MERN Library Project
## This project uses React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Express.js and Node. 
## I plan to expand this CRUD application further as well improving the UI and UX.
I recently got into reading more and wanted to catalogue the books that I owned. 
I learned how to create a full-stack application to store the Title, Author and published year for my books.
It was challenging learning the frameworks and technologies to connect the backend and frontend but through trial and error I figured 
out the routing, 
### To create and use yourself, read below 
Create your own free mongoDB cluster to use this library application, click on 'connect' on the cluster then select -> 
"Connecting with MongoDB for VS Code", copy and paste the connection string then paste it in _config.js_ in the **backend** folder.
Create two terminals, one for backend and one for frontend.Type _npm run dev_ on both and ctrl+click on the frontend link.
